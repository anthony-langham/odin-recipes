    <p>
      Comfort food doesn't get much more classic than this Italian favourite,
      featuring layers of rich beef mince and a creamy sauce
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
      <li>1 celery stalk, diced</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
      <li>250g beef mince</li>
      <li>250g pork mince</li>
      <li>1 tbsp tomato pur√©e</li>
      <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion,
        carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince
        and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the
        wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato pur√©e, chopped
        tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15
        mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.
      </li>

        Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan
        over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low
        for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until
        you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk
        constantly until the sauce thickens.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200¬∞C, fan 180¬∞C. Layer up the lasagne in a
        baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta,
        then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella
        then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and
        bubbling on top. Serve immediately.
